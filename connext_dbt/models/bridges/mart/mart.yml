        This model combines data from two bridge models, `cln_debridge_txs` and `cln_hop_txs`, to create a comprehensive view of bridge transactions.
        It uses the `UNION ALL` operator to concatenate the data from both sources, ensuring all records from both bridges are included.
        The resulting dataset includes a unique identifier for each transaction, details from both the source and destination chains,
        and fields for gas fees, relay fees, and token amounts in USD.

        **Bridges:**
            - cln_debridge_txs
            - cln_hop_txs
            - cln_connext_txs
            - cln_stargate_txs
            - cln_synapse_txs
            - cln_symbiosis_txs
            - cln_allbridge_txs
            - cln_across_txs
        **Sample Data:**
