    description: >
      Extracts distinct transfer records from `source_synapsois_explorer_transactions` for the staging layer in the Connext DBT model.
      Converts `from_time` and `to_time` from seconds to `from_timestamp` and `to_timestamp` respectively.
      This table captures cross-chain transaction data from the Synapse Protocol Explorer.
