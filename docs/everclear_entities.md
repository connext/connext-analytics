### Summary of Each Component

#### **Architecture**

Everclear employs a Spoke and Hub model for handling intents and settlements across supported domains. Here's a breakdown of the process:

- **Spoke and Hub Contracts**: The core contracts that trigger and manage functions for intents and settlements.
- **SpokeGateway and HubGateway**: Gateways that facilitate the transport of messages between domains.
- **Hyperlane**: The transport layer used for communication between the Spoke and Hub.

**Entities Involved**:
- **Rebalancers**: Use the system to balance funds across domains.
- **Arbitrageurs**: Monitor the system to purchase discounted intents.

**Flow**:
1. Rebalancer creates an intent.
2. Arbitrageur picks up the intent.
3. Funds are moved from their wallet to the Spoke contract.
4. Intents are queued and sent to the Clearing chain.
5. On the Hub, intents are matched or converted into invoices/deposits.
6. Matched intents become settlements in the settlement queue.
7. Settlements are processed and sent back to the Spoke domains.

### **Flow of Funds**

1. **Intent Creation**: Rebalancers create intents, pulling funds from their wallets.
2. **Spoke Contract**: Holds the funds and increases the unclaimed balance.
3. **Intent Queue**: Intents are transported to the Clearing chain.
4. **Hub Domain**: Processes intents into invoices or deposits.
5. **Settlement Queue**: Processes invoices/deposits into settlements.
6. **Settlement Strategies**: Netting and xERC20 strategies used for settlement.
7. **Spoke Domains**: Final settlements are sent back, and users receive tokens or balance updates.

### **Components**

#### **Supported Domains**

- **Spoke**: Holds funds and formats messages for dispatch via the SpokeGateway.
- **SpokeGateway**: Dispatches and formats settlement messages.

#### **Clearing Layer (Hub)**

- **Hub**: Handles inbound intents and dispatches settlements.
- **HubGateway**: Dispatches messages and formats inbound payloads.

#### **Agents**

- **Lighthouse**: Manages queues and executes cron jobs based on configured thresholds.
- **Cartographer**: Creates a cross-chain view of the network state using indexing layers (subgraphs).

#### **Transport Layer (Hyperlane)**

- **Hyperlane**: Manages the transport of messages across the network.
