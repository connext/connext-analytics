--1. Clearing_Volume

-- Summary:
-- This metric represents the aggregate value of all transactions that have been
-- fully processed and settled within the system. It includes both netted transactions
-- and those settled through market makers.

--2. Netting_Volume: Volume of intents was netted (only Netting by other intents)
-- core logic, netted intents: these are the intents that are not in invoices table
 -- 2. Netting_Volume: Volume of intents that were netted (only Netting by other intents)
 -- 
 -- Definition:
 -- This metric represents the total volume of transactions that were settled through netting
 -- with other intents, without involving market makers. It is calculated by:
 -- 1. Selecting all intents that have been fully settled and completed
 -- 2. Excluding intents that appear in the invoices table (which represent market maker settlements)
 -- 3. Aggregating the total volume of these netted intents
 -- 
 -- The result is grouped by day, source chain, source asset, destination chain, and destination asset.
