-- INFO
-- This SQL script processes transaction data from the `mainnet-bigq.raw.source_de_bridge_explorer__transactions` table, 
-- extracting and transforming various fields related to token swaps and fees. 
-- It joins this data with chain metadata from `mainnet-bigq.raw.source_chainlist_network__chains` to enrich the transaction records with chain names and token symbols. 
-- The final output includes details about the transfer, such as chain IDs, token amounts, and associated fees.
